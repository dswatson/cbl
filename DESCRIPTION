Description: This package provides methods for learning causal relationships
  among a set of foreground variables X based on signals from a set of 
  background variables Z, which are known non-descendants of X. The confounder 
  blanket learner (CBL) uses regression methods with feature selection to 
  simultaneously perform many conditional independence tests, with complementary 
  pairs stability selection to guarantee finite sample error control. CBL is 
  sound and complete with respect to a so-called "lazy oracle", and works with
  both linear and nonlinear systems. For details, see Watson & Silva (2022) 
  <arXiv:2205.05715>.
