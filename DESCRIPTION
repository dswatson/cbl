Description: This package provides methods for learning ancestral relationships
  among a set of foreground variables X based on signals from a set of causally
  antecedent background variables Z. The confounder blanket learner (CBL) uses
  regression methods with feature selection to effectively perform many 
  conditional independence tests at once, with complementary pairs stability
  selection to guarantee finite sample error control.
